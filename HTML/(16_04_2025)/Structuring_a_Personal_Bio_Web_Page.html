<h1> Hi, my name is Sanjay</h1>
<h2>About Me</h2>   
<p>I'm currently learning web development. I'm passionate about technology and enjoy exploring how websites<br>
and applications work behind the scenes. I'm focused on building a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript<br>
 to create engaging and interactive web experiences.</p>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>   
<p>In my free time, I really enjoy playing outdoor games, especially cricket and badminton.<br>
These sports keep me active, help me stay focused, and are a great way to spend time with friends.<br>
Apart from sports, I also like listening to music, drawing, and solving logic puzzles.
