    <h1>Second Task</h1>
    <h2> Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is Sanjay, and I’m currently learning the basics of web development.<br>
     I’ve recently started working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I enjoy exploring <br>
     how websites are structured and how different elements come together to create interactive user experiences.</p>
    <h3>Skills and Learning</h3>
    <p>So far, I’ve built simple HTML forms, styled pages using CSS, and used basic JavaScript to <br>
    handle button clicks and console logs.<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" >MDN Web Docs</a>
 I'm focusing on strengthening my fundamentals before moving <br>
    on to more advanced topics like responsive design and dynamic content.</p>
    <h4>Goals</h4>
    <p>My goal is to become confident in front-end development and eventually learn full-stack <br>
    web development. I want to create useful and user-friendly web applications, and maybe even <br>
    build a personal website or portfolio to showcase my projects.</p>
